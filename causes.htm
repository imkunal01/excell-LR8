        <h2>Small Term Causes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dam or Levee Failure:</strong> Dams and levees are constructed to manage water flow and prevent flooding. However, their failure can lead to catastrophic consequences. Structural issues, inadequate maintenance, or breaches caused by extreme weather events can compromise these structures. When a dam or levee fails, a rapid release of water occurs, resulting in severe downstream flooding that endangers lives and damages infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Urbanization and Land Use Changes:
            </strong> Urban development and changes in land use can alter natural drainage patterns, contributing to increased flooding. The replacement of permeable surfaces with impermeable ones, such as concrete and asphalt, reduces the land's ability to absorb water. This leads to heightened surface runoff, overwhelming drainage systems, and elevating the risk of flash floods in urban areas.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="impact-box">
        <h2>Long-term Consequences</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heavy Rainfall:</strong>Intense or prolonged rainfall is a leading cause of flooding. When rainfall surpasses the soil's capacity to absorb water, excess water runs off, overwhelming rivers and drainage systems. The risk is higher in urban areas with impervious surfaces like concrete and asphalt, hindering natural drainage. This heightened runoff, coupled with swollen rivers, contributes to widespread flooding, affecting communities and infrastructure. </li>
            <li><strong>Storm Surges:</strong>

              Tropical storms and hurricanes bring about storm surges, a phenomenon where strong winds and low atmospheric pressure elevate sea levels. This surge can inundate coastal areas, causing significant flooding. Coastal regions are particularly vulnerable, and the severity of the flooding depends on factors like the storm's intensity, the coastline's topography, and the presence of protective barriers. Storm surges often lead to destructive flooding, impacting both coastal ecosystems and human settlements.</li>
            <li><strong>River Overflow:</strong>
                
              Rivers overflow when the volume of water exceeds the capacity of the river channel. This can result from heavy and prolonged rainfall, rapid snowmelt, or a combination of both. Overflowing rivers inundate adjacent floodplains and low-lying areas, causing widespread flooding. The impact is felt downstream as the excess water seeks lower ground, affecting communities, agriculture, and ecosystems along the riverbanks.  </li>
            <li><strong>Snowmelt:</strong> 
              Rapid snowmelt, especially during warmer seasons or due to sudden temperature spikes, contributes to river and urban flooding. As snow accumulates during colder periods, a sudden increase in temperature can trigger rapid melting. The resulting influx of water into rivers can overwhelm their capacity, leading to flooding downstream. Urban areas may face additional challenges as the melted snow combines with rainfall, exacerbating the risk of flash floods. </li>
